## Project Background

I created this project because the current commercial options didn't meet my standards. This PCB allows for greater flexibility and customization in managing multiple thermistors for your printer. 

For those interested, I’m planning a small production run of just 5 units. Due to the limited quantity, the price will be around $60 each plus shipping. If there’s enough interest, I’d love to create an improved version with a better MCU, more flash memory, and support for NTC100k, PT1000, and PT100 thermistors with a MAX amplifier, as well as automatic flashing with Ratos.
